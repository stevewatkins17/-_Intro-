### From my LinkedIN profile:


I am a multi-role data engineer, database architect & BI developer in (but not necessarily limited to) the Microsoft data technology and product ecosystem, specializing in VLDB (OLAP & OLTP) performance optimization and re-engineering for scalability. I solve the most challenging & complex database performance problems, applying tools and techniques honed over years of practice. My best value is realized when I'm applied to severe, business-crippling database/data-engineering performance problems, or complex scalability problems that require an expanded technical tool set, project management skills & a willingness to rapidly learn the business domain to deeply understand a problem & devise out-of-the-box solutions. My skills include on-premise infrastructure, SAN storage, advanced operational database administration, SSIS/SQL tool building, project management, training & presentation.

* 20 year technical career in databases & data engineering, delivering creative solutions wherever needed
* Specializing in SQL performance re-engineering, building tools & refactoring SQL code to optimize the data pipeline
* Expert in TSQL/Data development; advanced SSIS package/pipeline building; intermediate Python/C#.
* Full spectrum, advanced operational MSSQL DBA skillset -- HA/DR, Replication, Service Broker, high-performance/highly-available configuration
* I work best in high-pressure, highly visible problem spaces with high-performing teams. 
* I'm currently focused on improving using Python for data analysis and data engineering; optimizing data/file structures for Tableau analytics
* I look forward to re-engineering traditional, on premise data operations to highly-scalable & flexible AWS/Azure cloud-optimized frameworks.
